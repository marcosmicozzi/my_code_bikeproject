    "1. SFSO – Seasonal Focus Station Optimisation.\n",
    "Predicts seasonal demand patterns across all stations and segments, dynamically redistributing bikes to ensure high availability at peak locations while adapting to seasonal fluctuations.\n",
    "2. PMW – Predictive Maintenance Window.\n",
    "Identifies low-usage periods based on season, weather, day-of-week, and holidays to schedule bike maintenance efficiently, minimizing downtime and ensuring bikes are operational during peak demand.\n",
    "3. EDI – E-Bike Demand Index.\n",
    "Predicts the required number of e-bikes per station or ward based on historical usage, station type, local geography, and contextual factors. Ensures minimum e-bike availability at high-demand stations while integrating seamlessly with total bike allocation predictions.\n",
    "4. WEUI – Ward Equity Usage Index\n",
    "A geospatial index that measures bike usage across wards, highlighting areas with lower-than-expected adoption relative to population and local income. Identifies underrepresented neighborhoods and informs data-driven strategies to improve accessibility, system coverage, and potential future member growth.\n",

    "Marketing-Driven KPIs\n",
    "5. GBS – Gamified Bike System\n",
    "Encourages desired user behavior, such as morning rides or consistent usage, through gamification, points, and psychological incentives that create healthy habits and increase engagement.\n",
    "6. C2M Strategy – Casual to Member Conversion\n",
    "Tracks casual riders’ cumulative spending and usage, offering targeted incentives to convert high-value casuals into yearly members, increasing retention and predictable revenue.\n",

    "Process:\n",
    "1. Merge predictions from all data-driven KPIs.\n",
    "2. Apply minimum e-bike requirements and maintenance constraints.\n",
    "3. Reconcile conflicts and ensure total station capacity is not exceeded.\n",
    "4. Generate a final, optimized allocation plan for each station.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "* Station-level deployment plan with:\n",
    "    * Total bikes\n",
    "    * Number of e-bikes\n",
    "    * Number of regular bikes\n",
